## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-27

### Release Highlights

This is the first stable release of Flow! ðŸŽ‰

Flow provides a unidirectional data flow architecture for SwiftUI applications with full support for Swift 6 Approachable Concurrency. After several months of development and refinement, the API is now stable and ready for production use.

### Key Features

- **No Global Store**: Each view holds its own state with `@State`
- **Result-Returning Actions**: Actions can return results through `ActionTask` for parent-child communication
- **@Observable Support**: Uses SwiftUI's standard `@Observable` instead of `@ObservableObject`
- **Approachable Concurrency**: Full Swift 6 concurrency support with `defaultIsolation(MainActor.self)`
- **Observable Actions**: Middleware system for cross-cutting concerns like logging and analytics

### Documentation

- Complete English translation of all documentation
- Comprehensive guides including Getting Started, Core Concepts, Practical Guide, and Middleware
- Real-world examples demonstrating best practices

### Breaking Changes

None - this is the initial stable release.
