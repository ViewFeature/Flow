## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-27

### Features

#### Task Naming Support

- **Added task naming for `.run` effects**: Leverages Swift 6.2's SE-0469 task naming capability
  - New optional `name` parameter in `.run(name:operation:)` for improved debugging and profiling
  - Task names appear in Xcode debugger, Instruments, and swift-inspect
  - Fully backward compatibleâ€”existing code works unchanged
  - Names are preserved through all configuration methods (`.catch`, `.cancellable`, `.priority`)

  ```swift
  // Named task for better debugging
  return .run(name: "ðŸ”„ Fetch user profile") { state in
      let profile = try await api.fetchProfile()
      state.profile = profile
  }

  // Dynamic naming with context
  return .run(name: "Load user \(userId)") { state in
      let user = try await api.fetchUser(userId)
      state.user = user
  }
  ```

**Benefits:**
- Tasks are easily identifiable in development tools
- Better observability during debugging and profiling
- Human-readable task names in thread lists and performance traces

**Requirements:**
- Swift 6.2+ (for Task naming API support)

### Documentation

- **Improved README.md**: Enhanced "Result-Returning Actions" section with clearer explanations
  - Explicitly mentions that `ActionResult` type can be freely defined per Feature
  - Provides better context for code examples
  - Clarifies how ChildFeature, ParentView, and callbacks work together
  - Emphasizes dependency tracking within the view tree

### Tests

- Added 6 comprehensive tests for task naming feature:
  - Basic task naming functionality
  - Backward compatibility verification (name = nil)
  - Name preservation through `.catch`, `.cancellable`, `.priority`
  - Name preservation through complete configuration chaining
- All 299 tests pass (293 existing + 6 new)

### Internal

- Fixed SwiftLint `function_parameter_count` violation in `Store.executeRunTask`

## [1.0.1] - 2025-10-27

### Documentation

#### Improvements

- **Reduced redundant expressions**: Simplified English documentation for better readability
  - Updated version numbers from 0.1.6 to 1.0.0 in Getting Started guide
  - Simplified opening description in README.md
  - Changed "Reduced code" to "Less boilerplate code" for clarity
  - Removed duplicate bullet point about compile-time safety
  - Consolidated middleware description from 2 sentences to 1
  - Simplified phrasing in feature descriptions

- **Added Japanese README link**: Added prominent link to Japanese version (README_jp.md) at the top of English README for better discoverability

All changes improve documentation clarity while maintaining technical accuracy and community-friendly tone.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-27

### Release Highlights

This is the first stable release of Flow! ðŸŽ‰

Flow provides a unidirectional data flow architecture for SwiftUI applications with full support for Swift 6 Approachable Concurrency. After several months of development and refinement, the API is now stable and ready for production use.

### Key Features

- **No Global Store**: Each view holds its own state with `@State`
- **Result-Returning Actions**: Actions can return results through `ActionTask` for parent-child communication
- **@Observable Support**: Uses SwiftUI's standard `@Observable` instead of `@ObservableObject`
- **Approachable Concurrency**: Full Swift 6 concurrency support with `defaultIsolation(MainActor.self)`
- **Observable Actions**: Middleware system for cross-cutting concerns like logging and analytics

### Documentation

- Complete English translation of all documentation
- Comprehensive guides including Getting Started, Core Concepts, Practical Guide, and Middleware
- Real-world examples demonstrating best practices

### Breaking Changes

None - this is the initial stable release.
